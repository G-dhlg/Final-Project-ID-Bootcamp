# Final Project ID Bootcamp

The goal of this project is to create a prediction model for cancer detection.
As cancer is a very complicated condition due to its variability depending on the area affected, I decided to focus on a specific cancer.
For this I gathered data from National Lung Screening Test(NSLT)

## Information 
  The data was divided in multiple sections:
### Data sets
  There are 5 different data sets:
    The first gives the personal information and summarize data of each patient
    The second has the information about the type of screening the patient received
    The third shows the results found from the screening type
    The fourth compares the results found in the previous data set to see abnormal growths
    The final data set has all the information about the cancer that the patient has

There are multiple columns that are shared between each data sets and that is what I used to merge them. 
Merging the data caused some complication that I will describe later on

### Images
  The NLST also has some images of the screenings that show the cancers and other growths.
  The idea is to implement a neural network to process the images and gather the information directly from the images instead of the datasets
